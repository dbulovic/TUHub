Using the Pumping Lemma, show that: the language \begin{math} L = {0^i1^j0^{ij} | i, j \in \mathbb{N} } \\for \sum = {0, 1} \end{math} 
is not regular.\\ \par
To solve this problem I will use the proof by contradiction. First, we assume that L is regular and let \textit{p} be the pumping
length of L given by the Pumping Lemma. Now we can set a string: 
\begin{equation*}
x = 0^p10^p
\end{equation*}
It is clear that \textit{x} is a member of L, where \begin{math} i = p, j = 1 \end{math}. Since x is longer than pumping length \textit{p},
according to the Pumping Lemma we can split x into three parts \begin{math} x = uvw \end{math} where: 
\begin{equation} 
|v| \geq 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
|uv| \leq p
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
uv^nw \in L, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}
\end{equation} \par
From (1) and (2) we can conclude that \begin{math} 1 \leq |v| \leq p \end{math}. Since \begin{math} x = 0^p10^p \end{math} the first p symbols of
\textit{x} are 0s. Therefore, u and v must consist entirely of 0s. \\First possibility is that \textit{u} is an empty string,
\begin{math} v = 0^p \end{math} and \begin{math} w = 10^p \end{math}. However this case does not satisy (3). For example, if 
\begin{math} n = 2 \end{math}, then we can see that the string: \begin{math} uv^2w = 0^p0^p10^p \end{math} clearly is not a member of L. \\ \par

Second possibility is that \begin{math} |u| \geq 1 \end{math} and \begin{math} |v| < p \end{math}. Similarly, this case also does not satisy (3).
If \begin{math} n = p \end{math}, then the string: \begin{math} uv^pw \end{math} would have a far greater number of 0s in the first part before the
1, regardless of the distribution of 0s between \textit{u} and \textit{v}, therefore it also cannot be a member of L. \\ \par

Since for all possible segmentations \begin{math} x = uvw, \exists n \end{math} so that 
\begin{math} uv^nw \end{math} is not a member of L. Therefore, we can conclude that L is not regular, as per the Pumping Lemma.
