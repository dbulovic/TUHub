In Linux the python script can be called with:
bash run_InsertData.sh ./confs.csv ./journals.csv ./persons.csv ./pubs.csv ./theses.csv <host> <port> <database> <user> <password>

If the script ends without any error, it means that the connection to database is working.


The script presumes that python 3 and pip is already installed.
